            <title>[CXF-7581] SwaggerUIResourceFilter doesn&apos;t allow call to service endpoint</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-7581</link>
                <project id="12310511" key="CXF">CXF</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m using CXF 3.2.0 with Swagger UI webjar 3.5.0 and Spring Boot 1.5.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process of rewriting an api and trying to be backwards compatible with the existing one. There&apos;s one endpoint &quot;/images/&lt;/p&gt;
{imageId}
&lt;p&gt;&quot; that I&apos;d like to support. Unfortunately the SwaggerUIResourceFilter class specifically has a pattern that includes &quot;/images&quot;. Is there way to either customize the pattern or have that class take into consideration the entire path (i.e. if the call is &quot;/services/images&quot; vs if the call is &quot;/api-docs/images&quot;)?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky one...I wonder, does SwaggerUI, when pulling the resources, identify itself somehow with the request header, though it would be risky to depend on that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, given a JAX-RS endpoint and the fact that our UI resource becomes part of that endpoint, what is the difference between the queries issued by Swagger UI to fetch some Swagger UI .gif/etc and the queries to get some application specific .gif to a non-UI resource of this JAX  endpoint&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think we could make the decision based on URI, we always host Swagger UI under `/api-docs/` so we could identify ui/non-ui resources based on that. I already have a small fix, it seems to work just fine, doing more tests right now. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I recall SwaggerUI does not issue requests to &quot;/api-docs/&quot;, which is why the filter is there, to ensure our new api-docs endpoint gets the query...&lt;br/&gt;
thanks, Sergey&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you are very right, just did a real tests and it does not issue requests to &quot;/api-docs/&quot;, tricky indeed, looking on what we could do here, have a few ideas to try out.&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d suggest that the filter optionally checks, after the pattern matches, if the endpoint can satisfy the current request, similar to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/master/rt/rs/security/cors/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/rs/security/cors/CrossOriginResourceSharingFilter.java#L273&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/master/rt/rs/security/cors/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/rs/security/cors/CrossOriginResourceSharingFilter.java#L273&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if yes - then do not change the URI, but it has to be optional...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I will try both to see which one is simpler / better. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16288651" author="reta" created="Wed, 13 Dec 2017 03:14:42 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sergey_beryozkin&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;sergey_beryozkin&quot;&gt;sergey_beryozkin&lt;/a&gt; Pushed the commit, essentially using your idea but a bit simplified. So the SwaggerUiResourceFilter and SwaggerUiService use the same mechanism now to locate Swagger UI resources. Before redirecting to the /api-docs/ we check if the resource is physically present (if it doesn&apos;t, the SwaggerUiService will fail anyway as well). Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Sorry, but this does not work at all, and keeping opening URI connections to check the availability of the resources will get us new CVE pretty soon. But the simple reason it does not work is that you make a specific assumption that some custom image is available on the disk, but not in the database or somewhere else. Please revert it, sorry about it &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s rigth, the assumption was to check the resource physically present on disk (this is JarURLConnection which doesn&apos;t really open anything with respect to connections or alike, just locates entry in the ZIP archive). Sure, I will redo it using the CrossOriginResourceSharingFilter.java#L273 approach, in this case the endpoint will be source of truth. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, but please keep the UIService just getting a class resource as before, the ambiguity is only on the filter path.&lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunately, only having a knowledge that this request can be handled by the endpoint resource is sufficient enough, but please also keep this querying optional, disabled by default.&lt;br/&gt;
For example, we may have a class path resource and method on Path with a reg expression and we will get a match but that method may not need to do anything with the images/etc. &lt;br/&gt;
Thanks, Sergey    &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16289161" author="reta" created="Wed, 13 Dec 2017 11:49:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi Sergey,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, that&apos;s the main concern, the match won&apos;t guarantee anything really, but at least we would have checked if there is suitable endpoint(s) to handle this kind of request, besides just the `/api-docs/`. Best effort I guess with respect to what CXF can do ... Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br/&gt;
    Andriy Redko&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16289168" author="sergey_beryozkin" created="Wed, 13 Dec 2017 12:03:42 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi Andriy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I guess, practically, there would be indeed something like &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;preformatted panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;preformattedContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&quot;/images/{imageid}&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but we need to have a protection at the filter level against some unfortunate matches, this is why the whole method lookup should be optional, besides, in many cases, it all works just fine without the lookups, so having a non-optional lookup would be a small penalty for such cases...&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks for picking up this tricky issue &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, Sergey&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16289183" author="reta" created="Wed, 13 Dec 2017 12:13:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi Sergey,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s right. Have a question, just because we briefly touched on that, (may be we have some JIRAs about that), I was focusing more on current Swagger UI integration (which is build around classpath resources, thus the implementation was oriented on this case). But you mentioned picking up  Swagger UI from the database or somewhere else, which would essentially means to have the chain of resources + filters configurable / pluggable, using different strategies. Is it planned work or some ideas you have in mind right now? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br/&gt;

Thanks, Sergey&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16289454" author="reta" created="Wed, 13 Dec 2017 16:14:02 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi Sergey,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, make sense, last question please, the point you mentioned &quot;... URI connections to check the availability of the resources will get us new CVE pretty soon ...&quot; concerns. This is what we do at the moment in the SwaggerUiService by calling `resourceURL.openStream()` (which is functionally equivalent to `resourceURL.openConnection().connect()` followed by `resourceURL.openConnection().openStream()`). Has is been overlooked? Should we address the possible CVE scenarios here? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br/&gt;

                            <comment id="16289485" author="sergey_beryozkin" created="Wed, 13 Dec 2017 16:31:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi Andriy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UIService case it is &quot;URL resourceURL = URI.create(swaggerUiRoot + resourcePath).toURL();&quot; where swaggerUiRoot is guaranteed to point to the runtime classpath resource (in general - controlled by the server envronment), while in the reverted code you had the resourcePath passed directly, so I guess if that is decoded into an absolute URI then it can be a problem, while with the UIService case, which can be easily confirmed, concatenating the absolute the swaggerUiRoot with another absolute uri will throw the exception. Perhaps even that code should be further tightened, but lets deal with it after we fix this issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks   &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16289497" author="reta" created="Wed, 13 Dec 2017 16:39:20 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi Sergey,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hm ... probably we have confusion here, this was *&lt;b&gt;exactly the same code&lt;/b&gt;* === URI.create(swaggerUiRoot + resourcePath).toURL().openConnection().connect(), no arbitrary resourcePath anywhere, all rooted and server controlled. It was a quick check if the entry is present or not in the Swagger UI archive. Anyway, for application-specific Swagger UI deployment we cannot use it. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

No, there&apos;s no confusion, I&apos;was referring to the fiilter doing &lt;b&gt;if (resourceLocator.exists(path))&lt;/b&gt; which was bypassing &apos;swaggerUiRoot&apos;, and yes, it can&apos;t be used by the filter anyway, when checking the availability of some custom non swagger resources&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks, Sergey&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;That the thing, &apos;swaggerUiRoot&apos; was never bypassed,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cxf/commit/ef562f6c17a417081651d55364c4dc17191aa741:&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/cxf/commit/ef562f6c17a417081651d55364c4dc17191aa741:&lt;/a&gt; *&lt;b&gt;if (resourceLocator.exists(path))&lt;/b&gt;* was implemented as *&lt;b&gt;URI.create(swaggerUiRoot + path).toURL().openConnection().connect()&lt;/b&gt;* &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I&apos;ve completely missed exists() was referring to locate()...Hmm, was I totally wrong then ? I guess so, thanks for helping me to realize it &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so then your solution was very good, can you re-apply it please ? I suppose the chance that there will be a match to a swagger UI resource while in fact an application level resource is expected is very low and if that ever happens then we can reconsider the idea of the heavier method match. &lt;br/&gt;
Cheers, Sergey   &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I think it is a bit more widely applicable then just checking JAX-RS resources. People often use the custom servlets to handle static context, with the check in front we could be pretty sure that this is not a Swagger UI resource and bypass filter. Thanks again!  &lt;/p&gt;

Thanks, it looks great.&lt;br/&gt;
Can you please merge the locator specific code into 3.1.15-SNAPSHOT, it will probably be not the straightforward merge, but may be copy some relevant parts &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
