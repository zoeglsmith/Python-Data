# Automatically Informing the Cause of Software Defects(under supervision of Dr Daniel Alencar Da Costa)

## Introduction

This research aims to automatically identify the cause of software defects by analyzing issue reports from Jira. I use Python with regular expressions to extract relevant keywords from the reports. These keywords are then classified as causal or causal factors to determine the defect cause accurately.

## Methodology
I'm currently using Postgresql to store all of my data collection in

### Data Collection

I gather issue reports from Jira, which serve as valuable data for our analysis.

### Keyword Extraction

Im using Python with regular expressions, and extract important keywords from the issue reports.

### Causal vs. Casual Identification

I classify the extracted keywords to differentiate between causal and casual factors.

### Statistical Analysis and Confidence Level

Through statistical analysis of a sample of issue reports, we aim to achieve a 95% confidence level for the accuracy of our automated system. This is to ensure my algorithm has accurately gone through the issue reports and categorised each comments into the correct casual or non-causal factor
